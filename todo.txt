===TO DO===
* Gold elite boss w/ sword during chieftain wave
* elites use player melee animations instead of AI animations for carbine (melee almost never hits because of it)
* Invincibility despawns from player inventory on new round start (only sometimes???)
* enemies randomly stop spawning on alpha site (PHANTOM PROBLEM?) (https://discord.com/channels/415700035398008843/1190031935829983242/1368812131910287400)
* spawn gauss hog on lost platoon
* fix wraiths not dying when grenades are planted
* weapon lockers in map spawns
* rework flood cmds 
* flood version of phantom
* flood get stuck in spawn rooms on windward
* replace more brute flood with elite flood (cus of vehicle animations)
* do something with the mission objectives text in pause menu
* fix invisible weapon crate (spawns on alpha site, also needed for weapon racks)
* flood can't move out of spawns, they just stand around
* grunt variants shoot plasma pistol too fast (the pale colored one)
* test AI with older tagtool, new style defs may have broken flood ai (they stand still always now)
* investigate gauss hog respawns on lost platoon (possibly doesnt work)

===MAYBE TO DO===
* friendly engineers in flood mode?
* give elites equipment (regen fields?)
* Make elites jump into empty vehicles
* infected spartan bodies?
