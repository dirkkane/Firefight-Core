===TO DO===
* NEW MAPS (MCC WORKSHOP CONTENT ONCE TAGTOOL DEFS ARE FIXED)
* New floodfight maps (Flood spawning in falling flood pods instead of phantoms?)
* Engineer overshield effect for all enemies (WORKS FOR ENEMIES WITH PRE-EXISTING SHIELDS FML)
* infected spartan bodies?
* phantom turret animations
* Allied AI
* at least one new floodfight map that does not have engineers
