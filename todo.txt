* Gold elite boss w/ sword during chieftain wave
* elites use player melee animations instead of AI animations for carbine (melee almost never hits because of it)
* Invincibility despawns from player inventory on new round start (only sometimes???)

* spawn gauss hog on lost platoon
* fix wraiths not dying when grenades are planted
* weapon lockers in map spawns
* rework flood cmds 
* flood version of phantom
* flood get stuck in spawn rooms on windward

===MAYBE TO DO===
* friendly engineers in flood mode?
* give elites equipment (regen fields?)
* Make elites jump into empty vehicles
