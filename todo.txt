===TO DO===
* New floodfight maps (Wait for flood animations OR set spawn points in squads)
* Fix Engineer overshield effect for all enemies (WORKS FOR ENEMIES WITH PRE-EXISTING SHIELDS FML)
* infected spartan bodies?
* phantom turret animations
* Gold elite boss w/ sword during chieftain wave
* elites have no dialogue for some stupid reason
* some elites still have brute shots
* elites use player melee animations instead of AI animations for carbine (melee almost never hits because of it)
* Invincibility despawns from player inventory on new round start
* elites sometimes spawn on brute waves
* swap brute flood weapons from power AR to something stronger
* grunts spawn in jackal sniper spawns
* enemies randomly stop spawning on alpha site
* elites have trouble spawning in phantoms
* Make elites jump into empty vehicles
