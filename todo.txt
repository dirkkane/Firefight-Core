===TO DO===
* NEW MAPS (MCC WORKSHOP CONTENT ONCE TAGTOOL DEFS ARE FIXED)
* New floodfight maps (Flood spawning in falling flood pods instead of phantoms?)
* Engineer overshield effect for all enemies (WORKS FOR ENEMIES WITH PRE-EXISTING SHIELDS FML)
* infected spartan bodies?
* phantom turret animations
* Allied AI
* Make elites more aggressive with the needler
* Gold elite boss w/ sword during chieftain wave
* Elites spawning with brute shot (swap with carbine)
* Fix brutes spawning when they shouldn't (duplicate character palette entries, the C# only accounts for the last one found)
