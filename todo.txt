===TO DO===
* New floodfight maps (Wait for flood animations OR set spawn points in squads)
* Fix Engineer overshield effect for all enemies (WORKS FOR ENEMIES WITH PRE-EXISTING SHIELDS FML)
* infected spartan bodies?
* phantom turret animations
* Gold elite boss w/ sword during chieftain wave
* elites have no dialogue for some stupid reason
* some elites still have brute shots
* elite ultra doesn't pull sword out when stuck, still charges the player
* make it so only high ranking elites pull out swords when stuck
* elites use player melee animations instead of AI animations for carbine (melee almost never hits because of it)
* Minor and Major elites dont throw nades and dont throw more when catch is enabled
* Give drones with brute plasma rifles regular blue ones instead
* Invincibility despawns from player inventory on new round start
* elites sometimes spawn on brute waves
* swap brute flood weapons from power AR to something stronger
* grunts spawn in jackal sniper spawns
* enemies randomly stop spawning on alpha site
* elites have trouble spawning in phantoms
*
